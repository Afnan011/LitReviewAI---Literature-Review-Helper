We identify elements that indicate the third decade of September 2009 as a time limit for the present bull market phase which is thus to be followed by a significant correction. In this context we also interpret the Chinese stock market index SSE.   The third decade of September 2009 was accompanied with a stock market correction typically within the range of 4-5% worldwide. Taking into account the market patterns that followed the time of delivering the previous scenario we present an updated scenario whose critical time corresponds to October 28, 2009.   Assuming quite evident (as of November 12, 2009) termination of the correction due to the above critical time we extend - consistently with our methodology - the stock market forecasting scenario. The corresponding expected SP500 future trend is shown in Fig. 5 and it supports a potential average continuation of increases to as far into the future as the turn of February/March 2010.

The structure of these co-movements can be described as a graph where companies are represented by nodes and edges capture correlations between their price movements. Learning a timely indicator of co-movement breakdowns (manifested as modifications in the graph structure) is central in understanding both financial stability and volatility forecasting. We propose to use the edge reconstruction accuracy of a graph auto-encoder (GAE) as an indicator for how spatially homogeneous connections between assets are, which, based on financial network literature, we use as a proxy to infer market volatility. Our experiments on the S&P 500 over the 2015-2022 period show that higher GAE reconstruction error values are correlated with higher volatility. We also show that out-of-sample autoregressive modeling of volatility is improved by the addition of the proposed measure.

In this chapter, we identify and introduce two of them in details, i.e., information generation and information synthesis. Information generation allows AI to create tailored content addressing user needs directly, enhancing user experience with immediate, relevant outputs. Information synthesis leverages the ability of generative AI to integrate and reorganize existing information, providing grounded responses and mitigating issues like model hallucination, which is particularly valuable in scenarios requiring precision and external knowledge. This chapter delves into the foundational aspects of generative models, including architecture, scaling, and training, and discusses their applications in multi-modal scenarios.

As the traditional theory in behavioral finance states, the individual emotions can influence decision-makings of investors, it is reasonable to further explore these controversial topics systematically from the perspective of online emotions, which are richly carried by massive tweets in social media. Through thorough studies on over 10 million stock-relevant tweets and 3 million investors from Weibo, it is revealed that inexperienced investors with high emotional volatility are more sensible to the market fluctuations than the experienced or institutional ones, and their dominant occupation also indicates that the Chinese market might be more emotional as compared to its western counterparts. Then both correlation analysis and causality test demonstrate that five attributes of the stock market in China can be competently predicted by various online emotions, like disgust, joy, sadness and fear. Specifically, the presented prediction model significantly outperforms the baseline model, including the one taking purely financial time series as input features, on predicting five attributes of the stock market under the $K$-means discretization. We also employ this prediction model in the scenario of realistic online application and its performance is further testified.", "authors": "Zhenkun Zhou, Ke Xu, Jichang Zhao", "year": 2017, "source": "ArXiv"}, {"title": "Diagnosis and Prediction of the 2015 Chinese Stock Market Bubble", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09633v2", "abstract": "In this study, we perform a novel analysis of the 2015 financial bubble in the Chinese stock market by calibrating the Log Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model to two important Chinese stock indices, SSEC and SZSC, from early 2014 to June 2015. The back tests of the 2015 Chinese stock market bubbles indicates that the LPPLS model can readily detect the bubble behavior of the faster-than-exponential increase corrected by the accelerating logarithm-periodic oscillations in the 2015 Chinese Stock market. The existence of log-periodicity is detected by applying the Lomb spectral analysis on the detrended residuals. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck property and the stationarity of the LPPLS fitting residuals are confirmed by the two Unit-root tests (Philips-Perron test and Dickery-Fuller test). According to our analysis, the actual critical day t_c can be well predicted by the LPPLS model as far back as two months before the actual bubble crash. Compared to the traditional optimization method used in the LPPLS model, we find the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) to have a significantly lower computation cost, and thus recommend this as a better alternative algorithm for LPPLS model fit. Furthermore, in the LPPLS fitting with expanding windows, the gap (tc -t2) shows a significant decrease when the end day t2 approaches the actual bubble crash time. The change rate of the gap (tc-t2) may be used as an additional indicator besides the key indicator tc to improve the prediction of bubble burst.", "authors": "Min Shu, Wei Zhu", "year": 2019, "source": "ArXiv"}, {"title": "Ultra Strong Machine Learning: Teaching Humans Active Learning Strategies via Automated AI Explanations", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00961v1", "abstract": "Ultra Strong Machine Learning (USML) refers to symbolic learning systems that not only improve their own performance but can also teach their acquired knowledge to quantifiably improve human performance.

LENS addresses a key limitation of prior USML approaches by replacing hand-crafted explanation templates with scalable automated generation. Through systematic evaluation using multiple LLM judges and human validation, we demonstrate that LENS generates superior explanations compared to direct LLM prompting and hand-crafted templates. To investigate whether LENS can teach transferable active learning strategies, we carried out a human learning experiment across three related domains. Our results show no significant human performance improvements, suggesting that comprehensive LLM responses may overwhelm users for simpler problems rather than providing learning support.

Proceeding with an examination of AMM market microstructure, we show how non-linear price effect translates into slippage for traders and impermanent losses for liquidity providers.

Specifically, this excess return mostly come from stock selectivity ability instead of market timing. However for some reason such as fund capacity limit, fund manager change or market regional switch, it is very hard to find a fund could continuously beat market. Therefore, in order to get excess return from mutual fund industry, we use quantitative way to build the sparse portfolio that take advantage of favorite stocks by mutual fund in China A market. Firstly we do the analysis about favourite stocks by mutual fund and compare the different method to construct our portfolio. Then we build a sparse stock portfolio with constraint on both individual stock and industry exposure using portfolio optimizer to closely track the partial equity funds index 930950.CSI with median 0.985 correlation. This problem is much more difficult than tracking full information index or traditional ETF as higher turnover of mutual fund, just first 10 holding of mutual fund available and fund report updated quarterly with 15 days delay.

Notably, the statistical regularities in language track the 2007 stock market bubble, showing emerging structure in the language of commentators, as progressively greater agreement arose in their positive perceptions of the market.

We account for the damping condition of LPPLS model in the search space and implement the stricter filter conditions for the qualification of the valid LPPLS fits by taking account of the maximum relative error, performing the Lomb log-periodic test of the detrended residual, and unit-root tests of the logarithmic residual based on both the Phillips-Perron test and Dickey-Fuller test to improve the performance of LPPLS confidence indicator. Our analysis shows that the LPPLS detection strategy diagnoses the positive bubbles and negative bubbles corresponding to well-known historical events, implying the detection strategy based on the LPPLS confidence indicator has an outstanding performance to identify the bubbles in advance. We find that the probability density distribution of the estimated beginning time of bubbles appears to be skewed and the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the area where the price starts to have an obvious super-exponentially growth. This study is the first work in the literature that identifies the existence of bubbles in the Chinese stock market using the daily data of CSI 300 index with the advance bubble detection methodology of LPPLS confidence indicator.

We find that log-periodic power laws adequately describe speculative bubbles on these emerging markets with very few exceptions and thus extend considerably the applicability of the proposed rational expectation model of bubbles and crashes which has previously been developed for the major financial markets in the world. This model is essentially controlled by a crash hazard rate becoming critical due to a collective imitative/herding behavior of traders. Furthermore, three of the bubbles are followed by a log-periodic ``anti-bubble\'\' previously documented for the decay of the Japanese Nikkei starting in Jan. 1990 and the price of Gold starting in Sept. 1980 thus rendering a qualitative symmetry of bubble and anti-bubble around the date of the peak of the market. A set of secondary western stock market indices (London, Sydney, Auckland, Paris, Madrid, Milan, Zurich) as well as the Hong-Kong stock market are also shown to exhibit well-correlated log-periodic power law anti-bubbles over a period 6-15 months triggered by a rash of crises on emerging markets in the early 1994. As the US market declined by no more than 10% during the beginning of that period and quickly recovered, this suggests that these smaller stock western markets can ``phase lock\'\' (in a weak sense) not only because of the over-arching influence of Wall Street but also independently of the current trends on Wall Street due to other influences.", "authors": "Anders Johansen, Didier Sornette", "year": 1999, "source": "ArXiv"}, {"title": "Evidence of a Worldwide Stock Market Log-Periodic Anti-Bubble Since Mid-2000", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0212010v2", "abstract": "Following our previous investigation of the USA Standard and Poor index anti-bubble that started in August 2000, we analyze thirty eight world stock market indices and identify 21 anti-bubble.

We mathematically characterize anti-bubbles by a power law decrease of the price (or of the logarithm of the price) as a function of time and by decelerating/expanding log-periodic oscillations. The majority of European and Western stock market indices as well as other stock indices exhibit practically the same log-periodic power law anti-bubble structure as found for the USA S&P500 index. These anti-bubbles are found to start approximately at the same time, August 2000, in all these markets. This shows a remarkable degree of synchronization worldwide.

A bubble is defined by a faster-than-exponential acceleration with significant log-periodic oscillations. The faster-than-exponential acceleration characteristics are tested with several different metrics, including nonlinearity on the logarithm of the price and power law fits. The log-periodic properties are investigated in detail using the first-order log-periodic power-law (LPPL) formula, the parametric detrending method, the $(H,q)$-analysis, and the second-order Weierstrass-type model, resulting in a consistent and robust estimation of the fundamental angular log-frequency $\\u03c9_1 =7\\\\pm 2$, in reasonable agreement with previous estimations on many other bubbles in developed and developing markets. Sensitivity tests of the estimated critical times and of the angular log-frequency are performed by varying the first date and the last date of the stock price time series. These tests show that the estimated parameters are robust. With the insight of 6 additional month of data since the analysis was performed, we observe that many of the stocks on the South Africa market experienced an abrupt drop mid-June 2006, which is compatible with the predicted $t_c$ for several of the stocks, but not all. This suggests that the mini-crash that occurred around mid-June of 2006 was only a partial correction, which has resumed into a renewed bubbly acceleration bound to end some times in 2007, similarly to what happened on the S&P500 US market from Oct. 1997 to Aug. 1998.", "authors": "Wei-Xing Zhou, Didier Sornette", "year": 2007, "source": "ArXiv"}, {"title": "Statistical Facts of Artificial Stock Market", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0408358v1", "abstract": "The paper reports the construction of artificial stock market that emerges the similar statistical facts with real data in Indonesian stock market.

The LPPL model considers the faster-than-exponential (power law with finite-time singularity) increase in asset prices decorated by accelerating oscillations as the main diagnostic of bubbles. It embodies a positive feedback loop of higher return anticipations competing with negative feedback spirals of crash expectations. We use the LPPL model in one of its incarnations to analyze two bubbles and subsequent market crashes in two important indexes in the Chinese stock markets between May 2005 and July 2009. Both the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite and Shenzhen Stock Exchange Component indexes exhibited such behavior in two distinct time periods: 1) from mid-2005, bursting in Oct. 2007 and 2) from Nov. 2008, bursting in the beginning of Aug. 2009. We successfully predicted time windows for both crashes in advance with the same methods used to successfully predict the peak in mid-2006 of the US housing bubble and the peak in July 2008 of the global oil bubble. The more recent bubble in the Chinese indexes was detected and its end or change of regime was predicted independently by two groups with similar results, showing that the model has been well-documented and can be replicated by industrial practitioners.

Overall, our results demonstrate the promising potential for human-AI collaboration in scientific discovery, as well as the importance of designing systems that effectively integrate AI\'s capabilities with human intelligence.", "authors": "Gerardo Adesso", "year": 2023, "source": "ArXiv"}]'

      text="""Multiple papers discuss market bubbles and crashes, with some focusing on specific regions like China or South Africa. There are also papers exploring the use of AI and machine learning to understand market instability and predict trends. Some research even delves into the linguistic analysis of financial news to identify market sentiment and potential bubbles.

Would you like me to refine the search or focus on a specific aspect of the AI bubble and the stock market? For example, we could look for papers specifically on:

*   **AI's direct impact on stock market performance**
*   **AI's role in predicting market bubbles**
*   **The use of natural language processing (NLP) in analyzing market sentiment**
*   **Comparisons between historical market bubbles and potential AI-driven bubbles**"""
