Various predictive models have been designed to realize its early onset and study the long-term trajectories of cognitive test scores across populations of interest. Research efforts have been geared towards superimposing patients\' cognitive test scores with the long-term trajectory denoting gradual cognitive decline, while considering the heterogeneity of AD. Multiple trajectories representing cognitive assessment for the long-term have been developed based on various parameters, highlighting the importance of classifying several groups based on disease progression patterns. In this study, a novel method capable of self-organized prediction, classification, and the overlay of long-term cognitive trajectories based on short-term individual data was developed, based on statistical and differential equation modeling. We validated the predictive accuracy of the proposed method for the long-term trajectory of cognitive test score results on two cohorts: the Alzheimer\'s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study and the Japanese ADNI study. We also presented two practical illustrations of the simultaneous evaluation of risk factor associated with both the onset and the longitudinal progression of AD, and an innovative randomized controlled trial design for AD that standardizes the heterogeneity of patients enrolled in a clinical trial. These resources would improve the power of statistical hypothesis testing and help evaluate the therapeutic effect. The application of predicting the trajectory of longitudinal disease progression goes beyond AD, and is especially relevant for progressive and neurodegenerative disorders.", "authors": "Hiroyuki Sato, Keisuke Suzuki, Atsushi Hashizume, Ryoichi Hanazawa, Masanao Sasaki, Akihiro Hirakawa, the Japanese Alzheimer\'s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the Alzheimer\'s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "year": 2024, "source": "ArXiv"}, {"title": "High-dimensional regression over disease subgroups", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00953v2", "abstract": "We consider high-dimensional regression over subgroups of observations. Our work is motivated by biomedical problems, where disease subtypes, for example, may differ with respect to underlying regression models, but sample sizes at the subgroup-level may be limited. We focus on the case in which subgroup-specific models may be expected to be similar but not necessarily identical. Our approach is to treat subgroups as related problem instances and jointly estimate subgroup-specific regression coefficients. This is done in a penalized framework, combining an $\\\\ell_1$ term with an additional term that penalizes differences between subgroup-specific coefficients. This gives solutions that are globally sparse but that allow information-sharing between the subgroups. We present algorithms for estimation and empirical results on simulated data and using Alzheimer\'s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and cancer datasets.

Strong evidence suggests that permeable amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) oligomers, astrogliosis and reactive astrocytosis cause neuronal damage in AD. A large amount of Abeta is secreted by astrocytes, which contributes to the total Abeta deposition in the brain. This suggests that astrocytes may also play a role in AD, leading to increased attention to their dynamics and associated mechanisms. Therefore, in the present study, we developed and evaluated novel stochastic models for Abeta growth using ADNI data to predict the effect of astrocytes on AD progression in a clinical trial. In the AD case, accurate prediction is required for a successful clinical treatment plan. Given that AD studies are observational in nature and involve routine patient visits, stochastic models provide a suitable framework for modelling AD. Using the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach, the AD etiology may be modelled as a multi-state disease process. As a result, we use this approach to examine the weak and strong influence of astrocytes at multiple disease progression stages using ADNI data from the baseline to 2-year visits for AD patients whose ages ranged from 50 to 90 years. Based on ADNI data, we discovered that the strong astrocyte effect (i.e., a higher concentration of astrocytes as compared to Abeta) could help to lower or clear the growth of Abeta, which is a key to slowing down AD progression.", "authors": "Hina Shaheen, Roderick Melnik, The Alzheimer\'s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "year": 2023, "source": "ArXiv"}, {"title": "Diagnosis of Alzheimer\'s Disease via Multi-modality 3D Convolutional Neural Network", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09904v1", "abstract": "Alzheimer\'s Disease (AD) is one of the most concerned neurodegenerative diseases. In the last decade, studies on AD diagnosis attached great significance to artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic algorithms. Among the diverse modality imaging data, T1-weighted MRI and 18F-FDGPET are widely researched for this task. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) to fuse the multi-modality information including T1-MRI and FDG-PDT images around the hippocampal area for the diagnosis of AD. Different from the traditional machine learning algorithms, this method does not require manually extracted features, and utilizes the stateof-art 3D image-processing CNNs to learn features for the diagnosis and prognosis of AD. To validate the performance of the proposed network, we trained the classifier with paired T1-MRI and FDG-PET images using the ADNI datasets, including 731 Normal (NL) subjects, 647 AD subjects, 441 stable MCI (sMCI) subjects and 326 progressive MCI (pMCI) subjects. We obtained the maximal accuracies of 90.10% for NL/AD task, 87.46% for NL/pMCI task, and 76.90% for sMCI/pMCI task. The proposed framework yields comparative results against state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, the experimental results have demonstrated that (1) segmentation is not a prerequisite by using CNN, (2) the hippocampal area provides enough information to give a reference to AD diagnosis.

Moreover, most of those approaches are trained on a single dataset (i.e. cohort), which can not be generalized to other cohorts. We propose a novel multimodal multi-task deep learning model to predict AD progression by analyzing longitudinal clinical and neuroimaging data from multiple cohorts. Our proposed model integrates high dimensional MRI features from a 3D convolutional neural network with other data modalities, including clinical and demographic information, to predict the future trajectory of patients. Our model employs an adversarial loss to alleviate the study-specific imaging bias, in particular the inter-study domain shifts.

Ontology is designed for storing information about rapidly spreading and changing diseases with incorporating existing disease taxonomies to genetic information of both humans and infectious organisms. It further maps disease symptoms to diseases and drug effects to disease symptoms. The machine understandable disease ontology represented as a website thus allows the drug effects to be evaluated on disease symptoms and exposes genetic involvements in the human diseases. Infectious agents which have no known place in an existing classification but have data on genetics would still be identified as organisms through the intelligence of this system.

An uncertainty threshold separated samples into an uncertain (high-variance) group and a more certain (low-variance) group. RESULTS: We analyzed 1050 individuals, holding out half for testing.

A novel and effective strategy to obtain efficient and powerful treatment effect inferences is to incorporate predictions from generative artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms into covariate adjustment for the regression analysis of a RCT. Training a generative AI algorithm on historical control data enables one to construct a digital twin generator (DTG) for RCT participants, which utilizes a participant\'s baseline covariates to generate a probability distribution for their potential control outcome. Summaries of the probability distribution from the DTG are highly predictive of the trial outcome, and adjusting for these features via regression can thus improve the quality of treatment effect inferences, while satisfying regulatory guidelines on statistical analyses, for a RCT. However, a critical assumption in this strategy is homoskedasticity, or constant variance of the outcome conditional on the covariates. In the case of heteroskedasticity, existing covariate adjustment methods yield inefficient estimators and underpowered tests. We propose to address heteroskedasticity via a weighted prognostic covariate adjustment methodology (Weighted PROCOVA) that adjusts for both the mean and variance of the regression model using information obtained from the DTG. We prove that our method yields unbiased treatment effect estimators, and demonstrate via comprehensive simulation studies and case studies from Alzheimer\'s disease that it can reduce the variance of the treatment effect estimator, maintain the Type I error rate, and increase the power of the test for the treatment effect from 80% to 85%~90% when the variances from the DTG can explain 5%~10% of the variation in the RCT participants\' outcomes.", "authors": "Alyssa M.

However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer\'s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression.

PROCOVA-MMRM utilizes time-matched prognostic scores generated from AI models to enhance the precision of treatment effect estimators for longitudinal continuous outcomes, enabling reductions in sample size and enrollment times. We first provide a description of the background and implementation of PROCOVA-MMRM, followed by two case study reanalyses where we compare the performance of PROCOVA-MMRM versus the unadjusted MMRM. These reanalyses demonstrate significant improvements in statistical power and precision in clinical indications with unmet medical need, specifically Alzheimer\'s Disease (AD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). We also explore the potential for sample size reduction with the prospective implementation of PROCOVA-MMRM, finding that the same or better results could have been achieved with fewer participants in these historical trials if the enhanced precision provided by PROCOVA-MMRM had been prospectively leveraged. We also confirm the robustness of the statistical properties of PROCOVA-MMRM in a variety of realistic simulation scenarios.

Each cohort was analyzed under two conditions: one using the full cohort, including cognitively normal controls, and another excluding controls to test subtype robustness. Results confirm the three primary atrophy subtypes identified in earlier studies: Typical, Cortical, and Subcortical, as well as the emergence of rare and atypical AD variants such as posterior cortical atrophy (PCA).

However, how to exploit feature correlation remains a challenging problem for these methods. To comprehensively address this challenge, we propose a MRI-based multi-task decoupled learning method for AD detection and MMSE score prediction. First, a multi-task learning network is proposed to implement AD detection and MMSE score prediction, which exploits feature correlation by adding three multi-task interaction layers between the backbones of the two tasks. Each multi-task interaction layer contains two feature decoupling modules and one feature interaction module. Furthermore, to enhance the generalization between tasks of the features selected by the feature decoupling module, we propose the feature consistency loss constrained feature decoupling module. Finally, in order to exploit the specific distribution information of MMSE score in different groups, a distribution loss is proposed to further enhance the model performance.

Unfortunately, the diagnosis of AD using MRI is difficult due to the very subtle physiological differences between healthy and AD subjects visible on MRI. As a result, many attempts have been made to synthesize PET images from MR images using generative adversarial networks (GANs) in the interest of enabling the diagnosis of AD from MR. Existing work on PET synthesis from MRI has largely focused on Conditional GANs, where MR images are used to generate PET images and subsequently used for AD diagnosis.

Our main contribution is the design, evaluation, and optimization of DNN architectures of increasing depth for heart disease diagnosis. This work led to the discovery of a novel five layer DNN architecture - named Heart Evaluation for Algorithmic Risk-reduction and Optimization Five (HEARO-5) -- that yields best prediction accuracy. HEARO-5\'s design employs regularization optimization and automatically deals with missing data and/or data outliers. To evaluate and tune the architectures we use k-way cross-validation as well as Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) to measure the quality of our classifications. The study is performed on the publicly available Cleveland dataset of medical information, and we are making our developments open source, to further facilitate openness and research on the use of DNNs in medicine. The HEARO-5 architecture, yielding 99% accuracy and 0.98 MCC, significantly outperforms currently published research in the area.", "authors": "Nathalie-Sofia Tomov, Stanimire Tomov", "year": 2018, "source": "ArXiv"}, {"title": "Predicting Heart Disease and Reducing Survey Time Using Machine Learning Algorithms", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00023v1", "abstract": "Currently, many researchers and analysts are working toward medical diagnosis enhancement for various diseases. Heart disease is one of the common diseases that can be considered a significant cause of mortality worldwide. Early detection of heart disease significantly helps in reducing the risk of heart failure. Consequently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducts a health-related telephone survey yearly from over 400,000 participants. However, several concerns arise regarding the reliability of the data in predicting heart disease and whether all of the survey questions are strongly related. This study aims to utilize several machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines and logistic regression, to investigate the accuracy of the CDC\'s heart disease survey in the United States. Furthermore, we use various feature selection methods to identify the most relevant subset of questions that can be utilized to forecast heart conditions. To reach a robust conclusion, we perform stability analysis by randomly sampling the data 300 times. The experimental results show that the survey data can be useful up to 80% in terms of predicting heart disease, which significantly improves the diagnostic process before bloodwork and tests. In addition, the amount of time spent conducting the survey can be reduced by 77% while maintaining the same level of performance.", "authors": "Salahaldeen Rababa, Asma Yamin, Shuxia Lu, Ashraf Obaidat", "year": 2023, "source": "ArXiv"}, {"title": "Heart Disease Prediction System using Associative Classification and Genetic Algorithm", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5919v1", "abstract": "Associative classification is a recent and rewarding technique which integrates association rule mining and classification to a model for prediction and achieves maximum accuracy. Associative classifiers are especially fit to applications where maximum accuracy is desired to a model for prediction. There are many domains such as medical where the maximum accuracy of the model is desired. Heart disease is a single largest cause of death in developed countries and one of the main contributors to disease burden in developing countries. Mortality data from the registrar general of India shows that heart disease are a major cause of death in India, and in Andhra Pradesh coronary heart disease cause about 30%of deaths in rural areas. Hence there is a need to develop a decision support system for predicting heart disease of a patient. In this paper we propose efficient associative classification algorithm using genetic approach for heart disease prediction. The main motivation for using genetic algorithm in the discovery of high level prediction rules is that the discovered rules are highly comprehensible, having high predictive accuracy and of high interestingness values. Experimental Results show that most of the classifier rules help in the best prediction of heart disease which even helps doctors in their diagnosis decisions.", "authors": "M.

Methods and Results --This work was designed as a retrospective, single-center study of a hospital-based cohort. The 5060 CHD patients (2365 men and 2695 women) were 1 to 97 years old at baseline with 8 years (2009-2017) of medical records, 5051 health check-ups and 5075 cases of other diseases. We developed a two-layer Gradient Boosting Decision Tree(GBDT) model based on routine blood data to predict the risk of coronary heart disease, which could identify 86% of people with coronary heart disease. We built a dataset with 15,000 routine blood tests results. Using this dataset, we trained the two-layer GBDT model to classify healthy status, coronary heart disease and other diseases. As a result of the classification after machine learning, we found that the sensitivity of detecting the health data was approximately 93% for all data, and the sensitivity of detecting CHD was 93% for disease data that included coronary heart disease. On this basis, we further visualized the correlation between routine blood results and related data items, and there was an obvious pattern in health and coronary heart disease in all data presentations, which can be used for clinical reference. Finally, we briefly analyzed the results above from the perspective of pathophysiology. Conclusions --Routine blood data provides more information about CHD than what we already know through the correlation between test results and related data items. A simple coronary disease prediction model was developed using a GBDT algorithm, which will allow physicians to predict CHD risk in patients without overt CHD.", "authors": "Ning Meng, Peng Zhang, Junfeng Li, Jun He, Jin Zhu", "year": 2018, "source": "ArXiv"}, {"title": "(PDF) Heart Disease Prediction - ResearchGate", "url": "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349140147_Heart_Disease_Prediction", "abstract": "Feb 9, 2021 \\u00b7 Heart disease can be predicted by performing analysis on patient\\u2019s different health parameters.Getting Started Profile Account Settings \\u2026In this paper we carried out research on \\u2026", "authors": "Unknown", "year": "Unknown", "source": "Web"}, {"title": "Current Research for Heart Disease Biology and Therapeutics", "url": "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11476753/", "abstract": "Heart disease covers a wide range of structural and functional changes that affect the heart, including conditions like coronary artery disease, abnormal heart rhythms, congenital heart \\u2026", "authors": "Unknown", "year": "Unknown", "source": "Web"}, {"title": "An artificial intelligence model for heart disease detection using ...", "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772442522000016", "abstract": "Nov 1, 2022 \\u00b7 The paper focuses on the construction of an artificial intelligence-based heart disease detection system using machine learning algorithms.
